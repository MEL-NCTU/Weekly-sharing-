## 題目發想
1. CyberKnife uses a high-energy X-ray machine on a robotic arm to precisely deliver radiation beams that destroy tumor cells and stop tumor growth while avoiding damage to healthy tissue.
2. Before treatment, need to create a personalized treatment plan to evaluate the unique shape, size and location of the tumor, as well as the tissue and structures that need to be protected.
3. Clinical challenge:
    - CyberKnife mostly is used for ==tiny tumor==
    - It is a very ==time-consuming process==, It will take hours for two professionals (one doctor and one medical physicist) to perform the computer planning, and for complicated case, it will take a day to create the plan for a patient
4. ==In order to enhance the workflow, we want to train the AI to identify the location of brain tumors and contour it.==
